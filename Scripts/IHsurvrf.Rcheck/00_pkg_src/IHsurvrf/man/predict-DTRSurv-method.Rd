\title{Prediction Method: used in data generation process after estimation, when we want evaluation}
\usage{
\S4method{predict}{DTRSurv}(object, ..., newdata, stage = 1, findOptimal = TRUE)
}
\description{
Method to estimate the value for new data or to retrieve estimated value for
training data
}
\details{
param object A DTRSurv object. The object returned by a call to dtrSurv().

param ... Ignored. Used to require named inputs.

param newdata NULL or a data.frame object. If NULL, this method retrieves
the estimated value for the training data. If a data.frame, the
value is estimated based on the data provided.

param stage An integer object. The stage for which predictions are desired.

param findOptimal A logical object. If TRUE, the value is estimated for
all treatment options and that leading to the maximum value for each
individual is used to estimate the value.

dt <- data.frame("Y.1" = sample(1:100,100,TRUE), "Y.2" = sample(101:200,100,TRUE),

"A.1" = rbinom(100, 1, 0.5), "A.2" = rbinom(100,1,0.5),
"X.1" = rnorm(100), "X.2" = rnorm(100))
